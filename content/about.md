I am Jeremiah Brazeau; a software developer, pilot, pianist, and general hobbyist.  In my career I have worked for small startups, co-founding an Eletronic Health Records company around 2000, that unfortunatly was a little ahead of it's time, and working at Kiva Systems (little orange robots) which was acquired by Amazon.com.   I have also worked for large Companies (Amazon, Salesforce, Raytheon).  I have a broad interest in the space between Electrical, Systems, Computer, and Software Engineering.  While I studied Machine learning through my Masters in Computer Science I found the need to attempt to understand how systems could be more discretely modeled and built with a focus on predicatbility which led me back to school where I earned a Masters in Electrical Engineering.

Outside of work I find myself occupied by the need to constantly learning and trying new things.  In general I attempt to take on something new each year and over the years have earned my pilots license, jumped out of planes, took time to ride a motorcycle, attempted to learn to play the violin, learned to build furniture, and more.  I find that having a hobby and learning outside of work helps me to continously approach problems with a fresh and creative perspective.

At present I am employeed as a Distinguished Architect and SVP focused on helping teams solve complex business and algorithmic problems in creating Personalized Consumer Journeys (B2B2C).  I run an architecture team that has helped to drive a unifying architectural vision across multiple monolithic software stacks with a focus on our customers and their ability to drive Consumer Engagement.

#### Creative Thinking ####

I find interest in spending a few minutes each morning thinking outside the box.  This has led me to solving some pretty ambitious problems over time.  For those intersted you can look up some of the patents that I have received for my work.  Many of these have been put into practice in some shape or form over the years: [1](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/jeremiah-david-brazeau) [2](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/jeremiah-brazeau).
