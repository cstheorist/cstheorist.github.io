I have recently been thinking about methods that drive technology decision making across large organizations and how those decisions can shape the overall culture.  One area I have started to focus in on is when and where decisions are made and HOW a development organization engages in making decisions.

**Quick Background**

If I look at different organizations in which I have worked I have been at companies with a lot of process (Raytheon - CMMI Level 5 - Process Areas - ...) and those that have far few (startups set aside I would argue my experiences at Amazon would fit this bill).  Clearly both work - but they work in different ways (driven in part by the goals that they are aligned to).  What is important though is that in both cases many decisions were made in building and shipping products.
