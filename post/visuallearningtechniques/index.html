		  <p>While back in school I spent time studying the human visual system and worked on attempting to model that system in software through the creation of various Neural Networks.  The approach I took was to model various layers in the human visual system (LGN, V1, MT, etc).  The results I obtained at the time were interesting in observation but not practical in practice for a number of reasons (computation was to slow, lack of large training data sets, etc).  In the last 20 years a lot has changed so it got me wondering if any of those concepts or approaches had since been applied.  More specifically, if current models of detecting objects attempted to take a layered approach.  If I were to look at the problem with fresh eyes today I might attempt something like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a model that aims to detect lines and angles.</li>
<li>Create a model that takes the previous layer as input and looks for primitive objects.</li>
<li>Build up from primitive objects to complicated forms.</li>
<li>From complicated forms we can track time and learn types of interaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let us say that we want to create a model that looks for people in an image I might first look to reduce the raw pixels into basic shapes, then look to learn from those shapes what might be a &ldquo;head&rdquo;, &ldquo;arm&rdquo;, &ldquo;leg&rdquo;, etc.  Then from there I could look for what are the most likely humans.  Finally, we can look at if 2 people are interacting with each other (talking, touching, moving out of each others way, etc).</p>

<p>I would posit that an approach like this might work well where discrete detection of individuals is important (tracking a person in a crowd, tracking people interacting with each other, collaborative robotics, etc).  By building up from pieces I would invert the need to perform, for example, pose estimation given what I presume is a body and instead would derive a body from potential poses that I have observed.</p>

<p>There are plenty of problems that I believe that such systems could solve where we would want to track individuals in crowds and/or through occlusions (store automation, security tracking, OSHA Compliance, etc).  I wonder if such a method would be more robust to different and changing environments then models that attempt to simply identify people and then attempt to estimate pose and behavior after the fact..</p>

<p>If anyone has written or seen any papers in this space please share as I am curious what we might consider state of the art in this space today!</p>
